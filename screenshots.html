                <h2>Features</h2>
                
                <p><br/>Our application has many features that enhance its usability and the
                         experience of gameplay for the user. These features include an options 
                         menu, a how to <br/>
                         play screen, a pause menu, and other options that are easily
                         accessible to the user through buttons. We detail these features below, 
                          categorized by when they <br/>
                          are accessible. <br/><br/>

                          <b><br/>The Home Screen</b><br/><br/>
                          The user has several different options beginning from the home screen of 
                          our application. These options are to begin a new game, to view the how-to 
                          screen, <br/>
                          and to access the settings menu. The home screen appears as below: <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Tapping the “Play” button begins a new round of gameplay, defaulting to
                           the level of difficulty “Easy”. Tapping the button with the gear image
                           on it takes the<br/>
                           user to the settings screen. Here the user can select 
                           a new level of difficulty (“Easy”, “Medium” or “Hard”), which will dictate
                           how quickly new eggs are <br/>
                           generated during gameplay. The user can also 
                           turn off and on both the sound effects and music. Sound effects include 
                           noises that occur during gameplay, <br/>
                           such as the laser noise when a user 
                           “fires”, while music refers to the background music that plays at different
                           times throughout the application. Both of <br/>
                           these settings default to “On”, 
                           just as game difficulty defaults to “Easy”. The user can also select whether 
                           they would like to play in "Swipe mode" or "Tilt <br/>
                           mode". Swipe mode allows 
                           the user to control the motion of the chicken during gameplay by swiping
                           a given direction on the screen or to control it by <br/>
                           tilting their device 
                           in a given direction. From here, the user can return to the home screen 
                           by tapping the icon with the house on it, as seen below.<br/>



                           <br/><br/><b>During Gameplay</b><br/><br/>
                           During actual gameplay, the user has the option to access the “Pause” menu by 
                           tapping the icon in the <LOCATION> of the screen. This will pause current gameplay
                           and <br/>
                           open up a small menu that allows the user to resume gameplay, turn 
                           sound effects and music off or on, and to end their current game. To 
                           prevent incidents <br/>
                           of accidentally quitting the game, the user is prompted 
                           before the game actually exits if they are sure that they want to quit. 
                           If yes, they are returned to the <br/>
                           home screen, without their progress being 
                           saved or recorded. If no, the game is not ended and they merely remain in 
                           the pause menu. Strangely enough,<br/>
                            resuming the game will take the user 
                           back to the normal gameplay screen and continue on from the point that 
                           they left off at. <br/>

                           The user is also kept up to date of their current score during gameplay,
                           another notable feature that is recognizable next to the phrase “Score: “. 
                           This keeps <br/>
                           the user aware of their progress and is updated in real time as 
                           the user progresses through gameplay. These features can be seen in the
                           following images. <br/>

                           <br/><br/><b>Game Over and High Score</b><br/><br/>
                           After the user has lost a game, the “Game Over” screen appears. This screen 
                           is temporarily shown to the user and has no notable features. It is replaced<br/> 
                           automatically by the “High Score” screen after a few seconds. The high 
                           score screen tells the user the high score at their difficulty level followed
                           by their own <br/>
                           final score from the most recent round of gameplay. From this 
                           point, the user can choose to either “Restart”, which begins a fresh 
                           round of gameplay, by <br/>
                           tapping the restart button, or to return to the 
                           home screen by tapping “Home”. This option allows them to return to the 
                           home screen to change settings, <br/>
                           reread the instructions, and to begin 
                           the game again if desired. <br/>
